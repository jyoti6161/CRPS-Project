An end-to-end AI-powered solution to proactively identify customers at risk of churn and recommend tailored retention strategies. Built using **CatBoost**, **SHAP**, **FastAPI**, and **Streamlit**, and fully containerized for deployment.

---

## 🔍 Overview

CPRS predicts customer churn **30–45 days in advance**, segments customers into **risk tiers**, explains why they might churn using **explainable AI**, and recommends **actionable retention strategies** in real time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Predict customer churn with high accuracy.
2. Segment customers into **Low**, **Medium**, and **High Risk** tiers.
3. Generate **explainable business reasons** behind churn.
4. Suggest **rule-based + ML-informed** retention actions.
5. Enable real-time prediction through a user-friendly dashboard.
6. Integrate API-first design for CRM or Campaign tools.
7. Allow continuous learning through session feedback.
